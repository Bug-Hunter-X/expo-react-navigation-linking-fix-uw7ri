# Intermittent Navigation Issues with Expo Linking API and React Navigation

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered in an Expo managed workflow app using React Navigation, where deep link handling leads to inconsistent and unreliable navigation. The app sometimes navigates to the wrong screen or fails to navigate at all after receiving a deep link. This issue is intermittent and has been observed across various devices and Expo client versions.

## Bug Description
The problem lies in the interaction between Expo's `Linking` API and the React Navigation library. Although the deep links are correctly configured and registered, the app's state and navigation actions sometimes fail to update correctly in response to the deep link. This may be due to a race condition or asynchronous timing issue.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `expo start` to start the development server.
4. Trigger a deep link (the exact URL will depend on how the app is set up).
5. Observe the app's navigation behavior â€“ sometimes it will navigate correctly, sometimes it will not.

## Solution
The solution involves modifying the navigation logic to incorporate error handling and asynchronous flow management. For example, setting a timeout or using Promises to ensure navigation actions occur only when the relevant data is available. Also, consider debouncing the navigation logic to prevent multiple, possibly conflicting navigation attempts. The detailed solution is provided in `bugSolution.js`.
