While developing an Expo managed workflow app, I encountered an unusual error related to the interaction between Expo's `Linking` API and the app's routing mechanism.  Specifically, when a deep link was handled, the app would sometimes navigate to an unexpected screen or fail to navigate at all. The behavior was inconsistent, only occurring intermittently across different devices and Expo client versions. The app uses React Navigation for routing. The deep links were correctly configured, and I had verified that the URL scheme and path were being captured by `Linking.addEventListener`. Debugging revealed that the state updates within the navigation context weren't always reflecting the intended navigation based on the deep link.  I suspect some race condition or asynchronous timing issue between the `Linking` event handler and the navigation actions.
